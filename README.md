# Logistic-Regression-using-Gradient-Descent

Implementing following Machine Learning techniques

• Logistic Regression
• Gradient Descent
• Regularization
• K-Fold Cross-Validation

Sci-kit learn has not been used in order to implement the learning algorithm from scratch.

There are 2 iPython notebooks:
1) `Gradient Descent - example.ipynb`: Notebook explains the concept of Gradient Descent with the use of a function dependent on a random value 'x'

2) `Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent.ipynb`: Notebook implements Logistic Regression on a real-world dataset containing sonar recordings and the corresponding label ('Rock' or 'Mine')
