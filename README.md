# Logistic-Regression-using-Gradient-Descent

Implementing Logistic Regression algorithm and using Gradient Descent to optimize weights. Sci-kit learn has not been used in order to implement the learning algorithm from scratch.

There are 2 iPython notebooks:
1) `Gradient Descent - example.ipynb` Notebook explains the concept of Gradient Descent with the use of a function dependent on a random value 'x'

2) `Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent.ipynb` Notebook implements Logistic Regression on a real-world dataset containing sonar recordings and the corresponding label ('Rock' or 'Mine')
